description: |
  Scientific foundation models are now widely used to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins,
  yet are trained using very different architectures, modalities, and datasets. We show that these models,
  despite their differences, are converging to the same, universal representation of matter. By analyzing
  embeddings from 59 models across 5 datasets, we highlight failure modes in scientific models, highlight
  future lessons for training models to learn powerful representations, and provide ways to efficiently select
  models for downstream tasks.
