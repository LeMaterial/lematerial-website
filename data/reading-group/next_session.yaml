  description: |
    Despite their significance in catalysis, medicine, and sustainability, transition metal complexes are challenging to
    model due to complicated electronic structures, limited experimental data, and a vast chemical space. This talk
    discusses recent advances in accurately predicting the structural properties of transition metal complexes with deep
    learning, facilitating the systematic exploration of chemical space. We conclude by demonstrating the integration
    of these models with generative AI for exploring novel organometallic chemistries and reactions.
