**LeMaterial is an open and collaborative initiative** — and anyone with an interest in materials science, machine learning, or open scientific infrastructure is welcome to join. Whether you’re a student, researcher, engineer, or just curious, there’s a place for you in the community.

**There are no strict requirements to join**. We welcome contributors from all backgrounds — including PhD students, postdocs, professors, independent researchers, software engineers, and experimentalists. If you are excited about the intersection of materials and machine learning, and want to collaborate, you are in the right place.
